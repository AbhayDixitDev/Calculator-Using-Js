## JavaScript Calculator (calculator.js & calculator.html)

This is a professional-grade JavaScript calculator that provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. 

### Functionality

* Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Clear button resets the calculator for new calculations.
* Handles division by zero errors. 

### Understanding the Code Flow

The calculator functionality is achieved through the interaction between the HTML file (`calculator.html`) and the JavaScript file (`calculator.js`).

**1. HTML Structure (calculator.html):**

* Defines the layout of the calculator using HTML elements like tables and buttons.
* Binds click events on buttons to trigger JavaScript functions.
* Displays calculation results and intermediate values in designated areas.

**2. JavaScript Logic (calculator.js):**

* **Variables:** Stores user input (numbers and operator) and calculation results.
* **updateDisplay(value):** Updates the main display element with the clicked button value.
* **cal(button):** Handles button clicks and performs necessary actions:
    * **Number buttons:** Appends the number to the display.
    * **Operator buttons (+, -, *, /):**
        * Stores the first number from the display if not already set.
        * Stores the clicked operator.
        * Clears the display for entering the second number.
    * **Equals button (=):**
        * Retrieves the second number from the display.
        * Calls the `calculate` function to perform the operation based on the stored operator.
* **calculate():** Performs the calculation based on the operator and displays the result.
    * Handles division by zero error.
    * Stores the result for further calculations (chaining operations).
    * Resets operator and second number for the next operation.

**User Interaction:**

1. User clicks a number button.
2. `updateDisplay` function appends the number to the display (visible calculation).
3. User clicks an operator button.
4. `cal` function stores the first number and the operator.
5. The display is cleared for entering the second number.
6. User enters the second number using number buttons and clicks "=".
7. `cal` function retrieves the second number and calls `calculate`.
8. `calculate` performs the operation based on the stored operator and displays the result.

### Getting Started

1. **Save Files:**  Save the provided code snippets (`calculator.js` and `calculator.html`) in the same directory.
2. **Open in Browser:** Open the `calculator.html` file in your web browser.
3. **Use the Calculator:** Enter numbers and operators using the provided buttons. Click the "=" button to obtain the result.

**This project is designed as a single-page application, providing a seamless user experience.**
